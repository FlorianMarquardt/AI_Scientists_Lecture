# From Artificial Intelligence to Artificial Scientists

This repository contains code for the lecture series "From Artificial Intelligence to Artificial Scientists", as delivered by Florian Marquardt.

The main purpose of the lecture series is to review the recent rapid developments in the long-standing quest for producing artificial scientists, using the tools of AI. The past few years have seen extremely fast progress, mostly based on large language models and also reinforcement learning.

The lectures mainly discuss a mix of very recent, state-of-the-art research articles and classic foundational papers in this field.
